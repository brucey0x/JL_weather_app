# Intro

Creating a weather app following this tutorial from [Jonah Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI).

I'm going to use Typescript for the first time and try some basic typing.

## Project setup

-   Initiated `NPM`
-   Added `prettier`, `typescript` and `tsc-watch` as dev dependencies
-   added `git` and `.gitignore`
-   created `/build, /src, /public` structure and added `package.json` with `npm run test, build` scripts that output to `/public, /build` or run tests without emitting files.
- Configured ./vscode with `launch.json` and `tasks.json` to activate debug functionality within VSC. This was hard!
